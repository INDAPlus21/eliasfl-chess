Following symbols are descendants of the `Game` struct:

| `pub fn get_possible_moves(&self, _position: String) -> Optional<Vec<String>>`            | If a piece is standing on the given tile, return all possible new positions of that piece.                            |
| `pub fn make_move(&mut self, _from: String, _to: String ) -> Result<Option<Piece>, &str>` | If the current game state is `InProgress` and the move is legal, move a piece and return the removed piece (or None). |
| `pub fn set_promotion(&mut self, _piece: String) -> Result<(), &str>`                     | Set the piece type that a peasant becomes following a promotion. (`_piece` is "queen", "rook", "bishop" or "knight")  |

A dependency-free chess engine/library and cli test made by Elias Floreteng during the KTH DD1337 Programming course.  
Playable through the command-line.

> Note: rust-toolchain version at least 1.53.0 is required to run the project with cargo. Update with `rustup update`

Positions are represented as Strings with file (a-h) and rank (1-8) eg. "e2", "d7"

Following symbols are decendants of the `Game` struct:

| **Symbol**                                                                            | **Description**                                                                                                           |

| `pub fn get_possible_moves(&self, _position: String) -> Optional<Vec<String>>`        | If a piece is standing on the given tile, return all possible new positions of that piece.                                |
| `pub fn make_move(&mut self, _from: String, _to: String ) -> Result<GameState, &str>` | If the current game state is `InProgress` and the move is legal, move a piece and return the resulting state of the game. |
| `pub fn set_promotion(&mut self, _piece: String) -> Result<(), &str>`                 | Set the piece type that a peasant becames following a promotion. (`_piece` is "queen", "rook", "bishop" or "knight")      |
| `pub fn get_game_state() -> GameState`                                                | Get the current game state.                                                                                               |
